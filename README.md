# Data-Stats
The Aim of this Project “Data Stats” is to automate the process of taking out the stats from Data (currently this project is only supporting csv files).
anyone can easily generate statistical reports from the dataset in just few clicks.
Right now, users can upload their CSV files and do some Stastical calculations on clicks.

This software program has six buttons on his front panel:
 
Buttons[]          Function()
1) Open          : To read csv files.
2) Save          : To save files in any format.
3) CLT           : Displaying Mode, Median and Mean
4) SVS           : Displaying Standard deviation, Variance and skewness
5) Correlation   : Displaying Correlation Graph

Hence,
Programmers are not required to code to get statistics for every dataset. It will give an initial idea about the
nature of the dataset in which they have to work on. These early stats could help them to make
good decisions in early stages.This will also save a lot of time for the developers and learners.
